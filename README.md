# Problem-of-the-Week

Here are a few writeups and scripts I wrote for problems from the NAU Math and Statistics department's problem of the week challenge. Since the competition is over for the semester, I figured this would be a good way to highlight my proficiency in LaTeX as well as show off my mathematical writing abilities.

The problems I wrote up can be found here: https://naumathstat.github.io/problem-of-the-week/
